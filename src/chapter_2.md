*"Breaking things down and moving them into modules"*

### Topics
 - Modules
 - Associated functions and struct methods
 - `trait Add`
 - `trait Mul`
 - `trait AddAssign`
 - Deriving `Copy` and `Clone`
 - `trait Display`

What are we trying to do?
-------------------------
Our `main.rs` has turned into an ugly mess with everything residing in a single file. We would like to move things around a bit and make things tidier by moving everything to their own modules. Additionally, I got a bit carried away with maths stuff and ended up writing a simple `Vector2d` implementation we can use to simplify system logic.
