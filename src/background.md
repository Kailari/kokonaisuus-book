What?
=====

I've been toying with rust for a few times before, but never really got anything actual done. Now, I've tasked myself with learning how Rust really works by writing an ECS *(inspired by existing implementations, like **Specs**, for example)*.

This is a sort-of-a-diary of my findings on that journey. Findings of someone not familiar with Rust, directed towards anyone interested in learning Rust or otherwise enough of a lunatic to listen to my ramblings.

As we quite fast fall down to the abyss of runtime reflection, macros and some other arcane trickery, touching on upcoming or unstable language features when I discover why they are relevant, our journey is gradually fading further and further into the madness.

That being said, welcome, to our journey, which takes us **Step by Step Towards Insanity**.
