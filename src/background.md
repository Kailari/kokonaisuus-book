What?
=====

I've been toying with rust for a few times before, but never really got anything actual done. Now, I've tasked myself with learning how Rust really works by writing an ECS *(inspired by existing implementations, like **Specs**, for example)*.

This is a sort-of-a-diary of my findings on that journey. Findings of someone not familiar with Rust, directed towards anyone interested in learning Rust or otherwise enough of a lunatic to listen to my ramblings. If you are already somewhat of a Rust guru, I sincerely apologize for any cringes my horribly hacked-together spaghetti might cause. *(Then again, if you encounter any typos or raging factual errors, you are welcome to file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kailari/kokonaisuus))*

As we quite fast fall down to the abyss of runtime reflection, macros and some other arcane trickery, touching on upcoming or unstable language features when I discover why they are relevant, our journey is gradually fading further and further into the madness.

That being said, welcome, to our journey, which takes us **Step by Step Towards Insanity**.
