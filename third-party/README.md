Files in this directory (and "src/img/ferris/") are borrowed respecting the almighty legal borrow-checker. Immutable borrow hapens from [rust-lang/book](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/blob/master/) repository. These files allow adding the "This does not compile!" or "This code panics!" -ferris icons to code snippets on the book.

I do not own these scripts nor do I own the icons. See attached license documents and Copyright notice for more information on licensing.
